### Usage of Token

Lordmancer II encourages using of a cryptocurrency token named Lord Coin (LC) as a payment method for player-to-player trades, facilitating sales of unique or rare game content. LC tokens enter the game economy only after they were purchased at a cryptocurrency exchange. They can be taken out of the game afterwards and sold for a cryptocurrency. Game studio will provide players not familiar with cryptocurrency world with convenient ways to purchase LCs for fiat currencies.

Players will be able to trade on an open game market using LordCoins (LC) as a payment method. Whenever an LC transaction occurs, the game will charge a commission of 20%. Half of it will be burnt and the other half will move to a special Ethereum wallet named "Game Funds". Game Funds tokens will be used by the game studio to fund its operations: marketing and server costs, support of players.

Burning of a fraction of LCs with every in-game transaction provides for:
* Constant demand for LCs on the open market
* Bullish price pressure on remaining LCs
